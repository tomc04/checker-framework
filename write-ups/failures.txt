# failures 

I think the LLM had some issues parsing through the files initially, because it's a larger codebase. It 
felt look it took more time thinking on fixes than in previous assignments. Another thing was that it would
continually try to fix the tests under the forbidden section (which I believe is not part of the issue and
does not need to be addressed). This caused it to go on a few loops because it would try to come up with a 
solution but it nevered worked. Also as for setup, the software versions installed on my computer were not
compatible, so I needed an upgrade. I tried using the LLM to help but it would struggle. I ended up taking
a mix of suggestions from it along with web information to do it myself.
