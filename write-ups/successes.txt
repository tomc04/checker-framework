# successes

When given the issue and a short explanation of what to do, the LLM was able to come up with a few fixes. 
I also mentioned the tests that were being run, so it can run them against the code changes, checking 
whether its (the LLM's) updates had any impact. If there were no impact, the LLM was quick to come up with new changes 
and try again. I believe it was able to pass the tests that pertain to the issue.
